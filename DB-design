Database Design
• Database design is an art form of its own with particular skills and
experience.
• Our goal is to avoid the really bad mistakes and design clean and
easily understood databases.
• Others may performance tune things later.
• Database design starts with a picture...

Building a Data Model
• Drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then
figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships
• Basic Rule: Donʼt put the same string data in twice - use a relationship
instead
• When there is one thing in the “real world” there should only be one
copy of that thing in the database

For each “piece of info”
...
• Is the column an object or an
attribute of another object?
• Once we define objects, we need
to define the relationships
between objects.

Normalization
and Foreign Keys
We want to keep track of which band is the “
creator
” of each music track...
What album does this song “belong to”?
Which album is this song related to?

Database Normalization (3NF)
There is *tons* of database theory - way too much to understand
without excessive predicate calculus
• Do not replicate data. Instead, reference data. Point at data.
• Use integers for keys and for references.
• Add a special “key” column to each table, which you will make
references to.

Integer Reference Pattern
We use integer columns in one
table to reference (or look up)
rows in another table. 

Key Terminology
Three Kinds of Keys
• Primary key - generally an integer autoincrement field
• Logical key - what the outside world uses
for lookup
• Foreign key - generally an integer key
pointing to a row in another table

Primary Key Rules
Best practices:
• Never use your logical key as the primary key.
• Logical keys can and do change, albeit slowly.
• Relationships that are based on matching
string fields are less efficient than integers.

Foreign Keys
• A foreign key is when a table has a
column containing a key that points
to the primary key of another table.
• When all primary keys are integers,
then all foreign keys are integers. This
is good - very good.
